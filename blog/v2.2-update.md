# v2.2.1 update! (edit)

Found a few bugs with the update, they have been fixed. 
- Discord bot will no longer crash if a leaderboard doesn't have any players.
- Added FAQ redirect and link in cards.
- Added the Towers Completed leaderboard to the card, made area completions display the amount instead of a list.

Enjoy this tiny update! :)
