# Friend Leaderboards!
You can now view any of the leaderboards with only your friends on it. Friends who have not had a card requested (or do not have any stats) will not have their PFP loaded and their amount displayed as 0 for performance reasons. 

## How to use?
* Use our [Discord Bot](https://jtoh.pro/discord-bot)'s leaderboard command with the new `friends-of` command option. Simply provide your Roblox username to view your friend leaderboard. (Or pass someone else's username to view theirs of course.)
* View any leaderboard at https://jtoh.pro/app/leaderboards, if you are logged in you will see a "View friends only leaderboard." link. Click it to see your friend leaderboard. Changing pages or leaderboard types will stay friends only until you open the page again.
* Add `&friendsOf=<user>` to the end of the leaderboard URL. For example, my friend leaderboard for CSCD skill points URL would be `https://jtoh.pro/app/leaderboards?type=skill-points&other=cscd&page=1&friendsOf=LoveliestJacob`.

Just like everywhere else, user can either be a username or a user id (`!<userid>`)

**Note:** Some friends may not appear due to their Roblox privacy settings, I cannot circumvent this.
