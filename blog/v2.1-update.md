# v2.1 Security Update
Multiple security improvements and bug fixes have been released to fix issues with the website. **Feature changes** are coming next update.

The only two import changes are the following:

## Removal of the Card Requests Leaderboard
jtoh.pro is a free service that I work on in my free time as a fun addition to the other tooling that is available to the EToH community on the web. However, this hasn't stopped bad actors from abusing the website and it's features. 

One of the most abused features was the card requests leaderboard. At the time of it's creation, the website was not used much at all. And because of this, it was pretty harmless. However, as the website has become more known, people have decided to spam requests *(wayyy more then the webserver can handle)* which has caused it to crash and become unresponsive on multiple occasions. Because of this, it has been hidden and will no longer be viewable to the public. Other leaderboards will continue to work. 

*If you were leaderboard banned for abusing, you will not be unbanned.* If you were banned by mistake, please let us know at https://discord.jtoh.pro

Now that brings the question. *"Can't people still spam card requests even after the leaderboard has been removed?"* Well of course they can, however the next change will fix that issue.

## Cached Cards
It's honestly a little shocking that I never added this beforehand. (From a basic security perspective.) Card data is now cached for a couple minutes, meaning spammed requests will no longer cause any issues. 

Note that the cards themselves are not cached. You can change your card background and the card will update, however your data will stay the same. (Leaderboard placement can also update along with small stuff such as your avatar.)

Below is an example of what a cached card will display in the small status section below the jtoh.pro watermark.

Hopefully this fixes any issues you all have been facing recently. I can't wait to release what I have in store next!
