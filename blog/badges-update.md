Title: Roblox Badges Update
Summary: Roblox is changing how we can check badges.

# Roblox is updating how badge *checking* works.

On March 23, 2026 (only ONE month from now) Roblox will be completely disabling unauthenticated badge checking.

**What does this mean???**
Basically, badge checking (which is how we check your tower completions), is not only going to become a lot slower, but we will also no longer be able to check your stats if your inventory is private. (And no, you currently cannot make your badges public without making your **ENTIRE** inventory public.)

**Well, what next?**
Honestly, I'm not sure yet. Checking **everyone's** progress is going to likely be a thing of the past now, which sucks a lot.
Assuming we get past this change, the following things will likely be different:
* ❌ Checking anyones stats.
* ✅ Checking stats of those who have public inventories. 
* ✅ Checking your own stats. (Will likely require you to be logged into the website if your inventory is private, so we can request inventory access. Or badge access if Roblox adds a specific scope for it.)

*Note that this change does not impact Roblox games who check your badges while you are in-game. So your EToH progress is fine and your badges are not going anywhere.*

I decided to go ahead and make a quick announcement about this, feel free to share your thoughts on this new issue! I'll post another announcement once a solution has been found. ❤️
