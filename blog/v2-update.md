# Version 2 is here!

The long awaited version 2 of jtoh.pro has finally arrived, bringing you brand new features and an overhaul of the website's design.

## What's new?

- **CSCD has been added!**
- **Card backgrounds!** *(More card customization in the next update.)*
- Cared redesign. The card's design has been improved, as well as inclusion of new stats such as skill points and leaderboard rank. Improved card readability as well for dark difficulty colors. 
- Leaderboard overhaul. You can now sort through pages and see what page you are on the leaderboard. This includes 3 new leaderboards and a rename of the current one.
- Account login has been added. You can login with your Roblox account to modify your card appearance. 
- **Website themes have been added!** You can now change between light mode and dark mode using the brush icon at the top of every page. The default theme is based on your browser/operating system preferences. 
- Removed 'Buy me a coffee.' in preference for a direct link instead, this is to prevent tracking cookies that I wasn't aware of being present in the embed previously. 
- Added cloudflare captcha's around the site for expensive server operations as a security measure. 
- Website stats have been improved. Failed card requests are no longer counted. This includes leaderboard card request counts. 
- With the addition of so many features, the website has gone under many performance modifications. Hopefully these improvements will prevent the website from loading slower then you may have been used to previously. If this is not the case, please let us know! 
- Added charts for website stats.
- Added blogs! *(If that wasn't obvious, lol.)*
- Added the ability to view your badge progress across many games. Note that this is an early stage implementation of this feature and it will be improved in a future update. 
- A ton of bug fixes, especially with card loading.
- JToH as been renamed to EToH everywhere on the website. Some link redirects have been put in place to prevent help with this change.
- Update log has been removed in favour of blogs. You can view the previous update log here: https://jtoh.pro/app/blog/prev-update-log
- Domain format has been removed, urls will just be on the main domain moving forward.

*And plenty more! ðŸ’–*

*If you are curious why jtoh.pro hasn't been renamed to etoh.pro: The simple answer is that I'm not spending more money on a domain.*
